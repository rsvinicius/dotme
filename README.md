A command-line tool to apply dotfiles from a Git repository to your current working directory.

## üöÄ Overview

`dotme` is a simple utility that helps you quickly set up your development environment by applying dotfiles from a Git repository. It only copies files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) from the root of the specified repository into your current directory.

## ‚ú® Features

- Apply dotfiles from any Git repository with a single command
- Only copies files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) at the repository root
- **Pattern-based filtering**: Include or exclude specific dotfiles using glob patterns
- **Default pattern configuration**: Set default include/exclude patterns for consistent behavior
- Recursively copies contents of dotfiles folders
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Save repositories with aliases for quick access
- Clear terminal output with information about what was copied and ignored
- Automatically cleans up temporary files after execution
- Comprehensive test suite with high code coverage
- Continuous integration and automated releases

## üìã Installation

### From Binary Releases

Download the latest release archive for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases) page and extract it.

#### Linux

```bash
# Download the tar.gz file (choose amd64 or arm64 according to your architecture)
curl -L https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.2.0/dotme_0.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -o dotme.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar -xzf dotme.tar.gz

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH (optional)
sudo mv dotme /usr/local/bin/
```

#### macOS

```bash
# Download the tar.gz file (choose amd64 or arm64 according to your architecture)
curl -L https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.2.0/dotme_0.2.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz -o dotme.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar -xzf dotme.tar.gz

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH (optional)
sudo mv dotme /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows

1. Download the [Windows zip file](https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.2.0/dotme_0.2.0_windows_amd64.zip).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Rename the extracted file to `dotme.exe` (optional).
4. Add it to your PATH or place it in a directory that's already in your PATH.

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme.git

# Change to the project directory
cd dotme

# Build the binary
go build -o dotme

# Install the binary to your PATH (optional)
go install
```

## üîß Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Apply dotfiles from a Git repository
dotme https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Save a repository with an alias
dotme -s my-dotfiles https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Apply dotfiles using a saved alias
dotme -a my-dotfiles

# List all saved repository aliases
dotme list-aliases

# Remove a saved repository alias
dotme remove-alias my-dotfiles

# Display version information
dotme version
```

### Pattern-Based Filtering

You can use include and exclude patterns to control which dotfiles are copied:

```bash
# Include only specific dotfiles
dotme --include=".vscode,.gitconfig" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Exclude specific dotfiles
dotme --exclude=".DS_Store" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Use glob patterns
dotme --include=".git*" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Combine include and exclude patterns
dotme --include=".git*,.vim*" --exclude=".DS_Store" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles
```

#### Pattern Examples

- **Exact match**: `.gitconfig` matches only `.gitconfig`
- **Glob patterns**: 
  - `.git*` matches `.gitconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.github/`, etc.
  - `.vim*` matches `.vimrc`, `.vim/`, etc.
  - `.*rc` matches `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.
- **Character classes**: `.git[ci]*` matches `.gitconfig` and `.gitignore`

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Set default patterns that will be used when no patterns are specified
dotme config set-default-patterns --include=".git*,.vim*" --exclude=".DS_Store"

# Show current configuration (aliases and default patterns)
dotme config show

# Apply dotfiles using default patterns (no need to specify patterns each time)
dotme https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles
```

### Example Workflows

#### Basic Setup
```bash
# Apply all dotfiles from a repository
dotme https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles
```

#### Selective Setup
```bash
# Only copy Git and Vim configuration files
dotme --include=".git*,.vim*" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Copy all dotfiles except macOS metadata files
dotme --exclude=".DS_Store,.Trash*" https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles
```

#### Using Aliases and Default Patterns
```bash
# Save a repository with an alias
dotme -s work-setup https://github.com/company/dotfiles

# Set default patterns to exclude unwanted files
dotme config set-default-patterns --exclude=".DS_Store,.Trash*"

# Apply dotfiles using alias and default patterns
dotme -a work-setup
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

`dotme` performs the following steps:
1. Clones the specified Git repository to a temporary directory
2. Scans the root of the cloned repository for files and folders
3. Applies pattern filtering (if specified) to determine which files to copy:
   - If include patterns are specified, only files matching those patterns are considered
   - If exclude patterns are specified, files matching those patterns are skipped
   - If no patterns are specified, all dotfiles (files starting with `.`) are copied
4. Copies the filtered files/folders to your current working directory
   - For folders, it recursively copies all contents (regardless of whether the inner files start with a dot)
5. Displays a summary of what was copied and what was ignored
6. Shows active filters if any patterns were used
7. Cleans up the temporary directory

## üß™ Development and Testing

The project follows a structured organization with clear separation of concerns:

```
dotme/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                    # Command-line interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/               # Implementation code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alias/              # Repository alias management
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fs/                 # File system operations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git/                # Git repository operations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/           # Pattern matching and filtering
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dotfiles.go         # Integration layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                   # Test code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alias/              # Alias tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fs/                 # File system tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/           # Pattern matching tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks/              # Mock implementations
```

All tests can be run using:
```bash
go test ./...
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **CI pipeline** runs on every push and pull request, performing tests, linting, and builds
- **Release workflow** automatically creates releases when version tags are pushed
- **Cross-platform builds** ensure compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows
