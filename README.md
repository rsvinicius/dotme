A command-line tool to apply dotfiles from a Git repository to your current working directory.

## üöÄ Overview

`dotme` is a simple utility that helps you quickly set up your development environment by applying dotfiles from a Git repository. It only copies files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) from the root of the specified repository into your current directory.

## ‚ú® Features

- Apply dotfiles from any Git repository with a single command
- Only copies files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) at the repository root
- Recursively copies contents of dotfiles folders
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Clear terminal output with information about what was copied and ignored
- Automatically cleans up temporary files after execution
- Comprehensive test suite with high code coverage
- Continuous integration and automated releases

## üìã Installation

### From Binary Releases

Download the latest binary for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases) page.

#### Linux

```bash
# Download the binary (choose amd64 or arm64 according to your architecture)
curl -L https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.1.0/dotme-linux-amd64 -o dotme

# Make it executable
chmod +x dotme

# Move to a directory in your PATH (optional)
sudo mv dotme /usr/local/bin/
```

#### macOS

```bash
# Download the binary (choose amd64 or arm64 according to your architecture)
curl -L https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.1.0/dotme-macos-amd64 -o dotme

# Make it executable
chmod +x dotme

# Move to a directory in your PATH (optional)
sudo mv dotme /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Windows

1. Download the [Windows binary](https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme/releases/download/v0.1.0/dotme-windows-amd64.exe)
2. Rename it to `dotme.exe` (optional)
3. Add it to your PATH or place it in a directory that's already in your PATH

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rsvinicius/dotme.git

# Change to the project directory
cd dotme

# Build the binary
go build -o dotme

# Install the binary to your PATH (optional)
go install
```

## üîß Usage

```bash
# Apply dotfiles from a Git repository
dotme https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles

# Display version information
dotme version
```

### Example

```bash
# Apply dotfiles from a repository
dotme https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles
```

This will:
1. Clone the repository to a temporary directory
2. Copy only files and folders that start with a dot (`.`) from the root of the repository to your current directory
3. Show what was copied and what was ignored
4. Clean up the temporary directory

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

`dotme` performs the following steps:
1. Clones the specified Git repository to a temporary directory
2. Scans the root of the cloned repository for files and folders that start with a dot (`.`)
3. Copies those files/folders to your current working directory
   - For folders, it recursively copies all contents (regardless of whether the inner files start with a dot)
4. Displays a summary of what was copied and what was ignored
5. Cleans up the temporary directory

## üß™ Development and Testing

The project follows a structured organization with clear separation of concerns:

```
dotme/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmd/                    # Command-line interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ internal/               # Implementation code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fs/                 # File system operations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git/                # Git repository operations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dotfiles.go         # Integration layer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                   # Test code
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fs/                 # File system tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks/              # Mock implementations
```

All tests can be run using:
```bash
go test ./...
```

## üîÑ CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **CI pipeline** runs on every push and pull request, performing tests, linting, and builds
- **Release workflow** automatically creates releases when version tags are pushed
- **Cross-platform builds** ensure compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows
